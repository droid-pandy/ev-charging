The "Proactive" EV Concierge (In-Vehicle Experience)
Problem: EV owners suffer from "range anxiety" and broken chargers. Current navigation just shows locations; it doesn't ensure success. The Agentic Solution: An agent that manages the entire charging logistics lifecycle, not just navigation.

What it does:

Predicts: "I see you have a trip to LA tomorrow and only 40% charge."

Negotiates: Connects to a charging network API to reserve a specific slot at a high-speed charger along the route.

Orders: Pre-orders coffee/food at the charging station for the driver while they wait.

Pays: Handles the transaction autonomously using a digital wallet.

Why it wins: It pushes "Connected Mobility" to "Autonomous Mobility" (automating the tasks, not just the driving).

Tech Stack: Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet), AgentCore to handle the multi-step "Booking" and "Payment" workflow.
